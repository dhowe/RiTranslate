How to install RiTranslate

Contributed libraries must be downloaded separately and placed within
the "libraries" folder of your Processing sketchbook. To find the Processing
sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window from the
Processing application and look for the "Sketchbook location" item at the top.

Download the latest RiTranslate.zip. Unzip it and Copy the RiTranslate folder into the "libraries" folder at this location.
You will need to create the "libraries" folder if this is your first contributed library.

By default the following locations are used for your sketchbook folder.
For mac users the sketchbook folder is located inside ~/Documents/Processing.
for windows users the sketchbook folder is located inside folder 'My Documents'/Processing

The folder structure for RiTranslate should be as follows:

Processing
  libraries
    RiTranslate
      library
        ritranslate.jar
        json-simple-XYZ.jar
        jsoup-XYZ.jar


After installing RiTranslate, restart processing.
